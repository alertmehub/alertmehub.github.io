# Getting Started
Getting started with the alertme service involves three simple steps:
1.	Signing up and creating topics.
2.	Deploying the alertme component into your application.
3.	Publishing alerts

## Signing Up
In order to use the Alertme service, you must first sign up for an account at https://admin.alertmehub.com/register/  

Pick a publisher id for your organization â€“ typically the domain where the Alertme component will be placed.  Pick a password, and provide the name and email of the administrator for this publisher id.  The email will only be used to contact the administrator with important information about the Alertme service.

## Creating Topics
After signing into the Alertme Administration portal, the first step is to define the Topics to which subscribers can subscribe to receive alerts.  For example, the bank contoso.com might define the following topics:
 - Low Balance Alert
 - Large Transaction Alert
 - Scheduled Transfer Reminder
The topics you define will be driven by your business model.
